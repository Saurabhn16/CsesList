StartupOnBoards is a platform I developed to connect founders, professionals, and investors. The idea came from identifying a gap in networking and collaboration within the startup ecosystem. I led the end-to-end development using the MERN stack. Key features I implemented include real-time chat for seamless communication, event management for organizing and promoting startup events, blog posting for sharing knowledge, and a robust search tool for easy discovery of professionals and investors. I also added a connect option for users to network directly and stay updated with relevant activities. I focused on building a secure and responsive platform, using JWT authentication for user security and MongoDB for scalable data storage. This project reflects my technical capabilities and my passion for creating meaningful, user-centric solutions in the startup space.
